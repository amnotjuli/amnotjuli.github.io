			<h2>FORMAT BASICS</h2>- 
			<P>file format developed by Adobe in the 1930s to present documents, including text and images. PDF was standardized as an open format, ISO 32000, in 2008 and no longer requires any royalties for its implementation. Three technologies combined for PDF: a subset of the postscript page description programming language, for generating the layout and graphics., a font embedding/replacement system to allow fonts to travel with the documents., a structured storage system to bundle these elements and any associated content into a single file, with data compression where appropriate.<p>   
<h2>FORMAT HISTORY</h2>- <p>was a proprietary format controlled by adobe it was released on open standard on July 1, 2008, and published by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO 32000- 1:2008 <p>
<h2>ADVANTAGES</h2>- <p>PDF supports graphic transparency. PDF contains tokenized and interpreted results of the PostScript source code, for direct correspondence between changes to PDF page description and changes to the resulting page appearance. <p>
<h2>DISADVANTAGES</h2>- <p>PDF readers are also susceptible. PDF can be providing a vector for attack by being configured to start automatically if a web page has an embedded PDF file. <p>
